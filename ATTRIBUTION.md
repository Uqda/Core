## Original Work

Uqda Core is derived from **Yggdrasil Network** 
(https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go), 
a decentralized routing protocol developed by:

- **Neil Alexander** (@Arceliar) - Lead developer
- **Yggdrasil Network contributors** - Community development

## License Compliance

Uqda Core maintains the original **LGPLv3** license from Yggdrasil.

All modifications and optimizations made by the Uqda project are 
also released under **LGPLv3**.

## What Uqda Changed

- Performance optimizations (timeouts, backoff, caching)
- Tooling improvements (uqdactl enhancements)
- Documentation restructuring
- Operational focus for production deployments

## What Uqda Preserved

- Core routing protocol (100% compatible)
- Cryptographic implementation
- Network architecture
- Security model

## Acknowledgments

We are deeply grateful to the Yggdrasil Network community for building 
the foundation upon which Uqda stands.

Uqda exists to **complement, not compete** with Yggdrasil, by serving 
users who prioritize operational performance and production readiness.
